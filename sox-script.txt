epeak-ng min speed may be 85


above period parameters
min duration of sound before silence removal is stopped, 
what is minimum length of sound, short noises will be ignored
maybe keep at 200 ms


second is what volume will be considered silence, 0 is pure silence

below period parameters
max duration of silence before sound copy is stopped, 
this can be kept short is wanting to remove all silence

position
    A position within the audio stream; the syntax is [=|+|-]timespec, 
    where timespec is a time specification (see below). 
    The optional first character indicates 
    whether the timespec is to be interpreted relative to the start (=) or end (-) of audio, 
    or to the previous position if the effect accepts multiple position arguments (+). 
    The audio length must be known for end-relative locations to work; 
    some effects do accept -0 for end-of-audio, though, 
    even if the length is unknown. Which of =, +, - is the default depends on the effect 
    and is shown in its syntax as, e.g., position(+).

    Examples: =2:00 (two minutes into the audio stream), 
    -100s (one hundred samples before the end of audio), 
    +0:12+10s (twelve seconds and ten samples after the previous position), 
    -0.5+1s (one sample less than half a second before the end of audio).
